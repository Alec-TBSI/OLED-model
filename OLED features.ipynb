    "# Features in OLED devices\n",
    "\n",
    "To fabricate OLED devices, there are various materials that are being used. Different materials are used for hole transporting layer(HTL), hole injection layer(HIL), buffer layer, electron transport layer(ETL) and of course the emissive layer(EML). There are many combination of the material and several architecture used in fabricating these devices. For this model, I am focusing on the BLUE OLED.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's take a look at the features used for our regression model. \n",
    "Every material has a distinct property. However each material has their own energy level, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital(LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital(HOMO) that can be measured measured. Another parameter that can be changed is the thickness of each layer. So, these three features are going to be considered for our model.  "
